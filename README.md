# House Manager

House Manager is a personal project exploring how AI can help homeowners stay on top of home-related information, maintenance, and follow-ups in a calm, practical way.

This project prioritizes product thinking, UX decisions, and applied AI. The code reflects an evolving, hands-on product and is not polished.

More details, documentation, and screenshots will be added incrementally as the product evolves.
