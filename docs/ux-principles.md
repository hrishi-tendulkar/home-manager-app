# UX Principles

Home Manager is designed to help people feel that their home is under control without demanding constant attention.

These principles guide product and UX decisions as the product evolves.

---

## Calm by default

The experience is quiet and steady.  
Information appears when it is useful, not simply because it exists.

---

## Capture first, organize later

People should be able to capture home-related information quickly, in whatever form is easiest at the moment. Structure is applied after capture, not required upfront.

---

## Designed for real life

Inputs are often incomplete, messy, or rushed. The product accommodates this reality without pushing users to “clean things up.”

---

## Reduce cognitive load

The product remembers details so users do not have to. The goal is fewer decisions, fewer reminders to self, and less mental bookkeeping.

---

## Defaults over configuration

Most users should get value without tuning settings. When choices are required, sensible defaults guide the experience.

---

## Support confidence, not anxiety

The product helps users understand what has happened and what may need attention. It avoids urgency where none exists and focuses on clarity over volume.
