# Home Manager – Overview

Home Manager is designed to help people stay on top of the ongoing responsibilities of owning and living in a home.

The product focuses on capturing home-related information as it arises, organizing it into a simple structure, and surfacing information and useful insights later when it is useful for decisions or follow-ups.

---

## Who this is designed for

Home Manager is built for individuals or families managing their own home.

It assumes:
- The home is personal and lived in
- Information is often captured inconsistently or under time pressure
- People want their home to feel under control without constant attention

The product does not optimize for rental portfolios, property management, or professional operators.

## Core mental model

Home Manager represents a home using three core concepts.

### Category
A broad area of the home, such as HVAC, plumbing, electrical, landscaping, or appliances.

Categories provide structure without requiring users to be precise or technical.

---

### Service
A repeatable activity associated with a category, such as a spring HVAC tune-up, monthly cleaning, or annual gutter cleaning.

Services represent things that may happen again and benefit from being remembered over time.

---

### Occurrence
A single instance of a service.

An occurrence captures the details of what happened, including the date, any vendor involved, cost if known, and supporting notes, photos, or documents.

Occurrences form the historical record of the home.

---

## Why this model works

Home-related information is fragmented in real life.

This model allows people to capture information in the moment, organize it later without losing context, and build a usable history of their home over time.

The structure supports recall and decision-making without requiring ongoing manual effort.

## Role of AI

AI is used to reduce effort and improve understanding within this model.

It supports:
- Conversational capture and clarification
- Summarizing past services and occurrences
- Providing guidance based on history, timing, and common patterns

AI operates within the system rather than defining it.
